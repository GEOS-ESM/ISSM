svn --username ????? co http://issm.ess.uci.edu/svn/slr

will download this directory and subdirectories under a version system called svn.

Once you have downloaded the slr code, you should add the following to your bashrc, or shrc or kshrc: 
export SLR_DIR=$HOME/slr/  (update to your own directory)
source $SLR_DIR/etc/environment.sh

if you are under tcsh or csh, do this to your .cshrc: 
setenv  SLR_DIR '/Users/larour/slr'  (update to your own directory)
source $SLR_DIR/Etc/environment.sh

Download and install ISSM as per instructions in
slr/components/issm/README

What we have in the code right now: 
README: this file
etc/ where we have our variable settings
components: where we have all our software ISSM, PGR, MITgcm, GEOS-5.
external packages: all our external libraries that we will be working with now. 

Web-based tracked svn changes are here: https://slr-svn.jpl.nasa.gov/trac/slr
